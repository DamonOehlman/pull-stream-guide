<p>This is a guide that walks through the general process of using <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr">dominictarr&#39;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream"><code>pull-stream</code></a> module.  The guide attempts to cover the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use pull-streams in a way similar to node streams</li>
<li>How to bridge between pull-streams and node streams</li>
<li>How to express application control flow using pull-streams</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-general-introduction-to-pull-streams">A General Introduction to Pull Streams</h2>
<p>The <code>pull-stream</code> module provides a functional approach to working with streams.  This is largely only apparent when you start looking at modules that provide <code>pull-stream</code> compatible Sources, Sinks and Throughs.  For this reason, the <code>pull-stream</code> module adds much less weight when <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserified</a> for execution within the browser environment.</p>
<h2 id="piping-using-pull-streams">Piping using Pull Streams</h2>
<p>While you can use a <code>pipe</code> function as per traditional streams when working with pull streams, I would recommend using in the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">pull</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;pull-stream&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">pull</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="nx">pull</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">values</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]),</span>   <span class="c1">// source</span>
  <span class="nx">pull</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">()</span>                <span class="c1">// sink</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
